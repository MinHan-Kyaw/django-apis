## Django API Project
This project serves as a Django API application providing data through a RESTful API endpoint.

## Getting Started
To run the Django server locally and access the API endpoint, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your machine
Django installed (pip install django)

## Running the Server
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-directory
2. Navigate to the project directory containing manage.py.
3. Run the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
  This command starts the development server. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the Django API.
